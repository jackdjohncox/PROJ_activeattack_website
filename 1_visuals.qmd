::: {.card .flow title="Attack Timing" expandable="false"}
Active attacks occur for a variety of reasons, sometimes they are
planned and other times not. Here, we show the timing of active attacks
from 2000 to `{r} years_max`, a critical element for premeditated
attacks with the goal of maximizing casualties. As the plots
demonstrate, some dimensions of time are more informative than others.

**By Year**\
There appears to be more events in the last five years (mean =
`{r} mean_last_5yr`) than the first five years (mean =
`{r} mean_first_5yr`) or second five years (mean =
`{r} mean_second_5yr`); however, this may be an artifact of media
coverage. Attacks that occurred during the first part of this data
collection period likely did not get the national coverage that they do
now. Furthermore, technology and search engines have improved
dramatically over the `{r} years` years of this data collection period.

**By Month**\
In contrast to the obvious upward trend in attacks across years, there
appear to be only a modest trend related to months of the year. Active
Attacks tend to peak during the warmer months of the year (e.g., April
through August account for `{r} warm_months_pct`% of attacks), though
this trend is not a strong one. The relationship with temperature is
similar to trends observed for certain types of violent crime (e.g.,
aggravated assault, homicide) that also tend to peak during the warmest
parts of the year.

**By Day of the Week**\
Active attacks share no observable association with day of the week.
This can be seen by the flat distribution of attacks across the week. So
while there may be trends by year and month, attacks appear to be nearly
equally likely on any given day of the week.

**By Hour of the Day**\
Active attacks tend to cluster around midday. While attacks that begin
at midday exactly are relatively infrequent (only `{r} midday_pct`% of
attacks), the majority of attacks occur immediately before midday
(8-11am hours account for `{r} late_morn_pct`% of attacks) or after
midday (1-4pm hours account for `{r} early_aft_pct`% of attacks).

::: {.card .flow title="Attackers" expandable="false"}
Many in the media attempt to create a profile describing the “average”
attacker. The data do not support a profile beyond sex and number of
attackers. Attackers were male `{r} male_pct`% of the time. Furthermore,
the attacker commits the attack by him/herself `{r} solo_pct`% of the
time. Beyond these characteristics, attackers are somewhat more varied.

**Attacker Race/Ethnicity**\
The racial/ethnic makeup of attackers roughly mirrored that of the
general population, though Caucasians were under-represented and African
Americans were over-represented. Most attackers were either Caucasian
(`{r} white_pct`%) or African American (`{r} black_pct`%). All other
racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Latino, Asian, Middle Eastern) only
accounted for around a quarter of attackers (`{r} other_pct`%).

**Attacker Age**\
While the median age of attackers was `{r} age_median` years old,
attackers ranged in age from `{r} age_min` to `{r} age_max`. Attackers
in their twenties were the most plentiful group compared to any other
decade of life. The age-trend of attackers adheres to the classic
"age-crime curve" observed for nearly every crime type, peaking in late
adolescence/early adulthood and steadily declining throughout the rest
of the life course.

**Weapon Type**\
Active attacks can be carried out using any weapon though, in reality,
only a very small minority of attacks (`{r} non_gun_pct`%) were carried
out using weapons other than firearms (e.g., knife, vehicle). Among
types of firearms, handguns made up a clear majority
(`{r} pistol_pct`%), while rifles (e.g., AR15s) and shotguns were used
in `{r} rifle_pct`% and `{r} shotgun_pct`% of the time, respectively.

::: {.card .flow title="Attack Location" expandable="false"}
Defining where an attack occurred can be difficult. For instance, on
January 8, 2011 a shooter attacked a meeting for U.S. Representative
Gabrielle Giffords. This attack happened in the parking lot of a local
Tucson grocery store. Had the attack happened in the store it would have
been classified as a business event; however, since the attack occurred
in the parking lot it is coded as an outdoor event. Bear these fine
distinctions in mind when examining the visualizations in this section.

**Location Type**\
As seen here, the plurality of events happen at places of business
(`{r} business_pct`%). Places of business include factories/warehouse,
retail locations, and office space. Around a quarter of attacks
(`{r} outdoors_pct`%) happened in public (outdoor) spaces. Schools were
attacked `{r} school_n` times (`{r} school_pct`%). These events are
aggregated and include attacks on all types of educational facilities,
including K-12 and institutes of higher education. Lastly, `{r} other_n`
attacks (`{r} other_pct`%) happened at "Other" locations (e.g., houses
of worship).

**Relationship to Location**\
In a vast majority of attacks (`{r} norel_pct`% of all attacks), the
attacker(s) had no prior association with the attack location. For
attackers with some relationship to the location, former/current
students (`{r} student_pct`%) and current/former employees
(`{r} coworker_pct`%) were the most common relationship types, followed
by indirect (e.g., the attacker's wife was associated with the location;
(`{r} indirect_pct`%)) and "other" associations (`{r} other_rel_pct`%).

**Relationship by Location Type**\
When looking within location types, we find that most attackers had no
relationship to the locations. Going beyond attackers with no
relationship,\
we find some interesting patterns. Despite making up only
`{r} coworker_pct` of attackers generally, attackers of businesses were
current/former employees `{r} business_coworker_pct`% of the time. A
similar trend is observable in schools, though in this case, the vast
majority of attackers were current/former students
(`{r} school_student_pct`%). Only a small percentage of attacks on
schools (`{r} school_norel_pct`%) were perpetrated by an attacker with
no relationship to the school.

**Time of Day by Location Type**\
When grouped by location type, the tendency of attacks to occur around
midday is still observable, though it is modest. The most noticeable
trend can be see with attacks at schools, where there is a strong
tendency for attacks to occur during the morning hours prior to midday.
Note: this plot shows the density of attacks *within* location types,
meaning that the concentration of attacks is relative to other attacks
within the same location type and *not* to concentrations displayed for
other location types.

There were `{r} format_num(casualty_tot)` casualties from active attacks
between 2000 and `{r} years_max`. Of these, `{r} format_num(kill_tot)`
people died. The visualizations in this section examine the casualties
of active attacks.

**Attacks vs. Casualties by Year**\
Attacks and total casualties (fatalities and wounded) have been
increasing over the course of data collection (2000-`{r} years_max`).
For specific years, however, there are noticeable spikes in the number
of deaths. These spike often correspond to some of the more well-known
attacks. For example:

-   **2007**: The attack on Apr. 16th at Virginia Tech, Virginia,
    resulted in `{r} virginia_tech_kill_tot` deaths, accounting for
    `{r} virginia_tech_kill_tot_pct`% of all attacks that year.
-   **2009**: The attack on Nov. 5th at Fort Hood (now Fort Cavazos),
    Texas, resulted in `{r} fort_hood_kill_tot` deaths, accounting for
    `{r} fort_hood_kill_tot_pct`% of all attacks that year.
-   **2012**: The school shooting on Dec. 14th at Sandy Hook Elementary
    School, Connecticut, resulted in `{r} sandy_hook_kill_tot` deaths,
    accounting for `{r} sandy_hook_kill_tot_pct`% of all attacks that
    year.
-   **2017**: The attack on Oct. 1st in Las Vegas, Nevada, resulted in
    `{r} las_vegas_kill_tot` deaths, accounting for
    `{r} las_vegas_kill_tot_pct`% of all attacks that year.

Of note, while the number of active attacks did not decrease during the
COVID-19 pandemic, the lethality of attacks in 2020 decreased to less
than half the number of any of the four years previous. In 2021,
however, the number of attacks increased and the number of deaths
returned to pre-pandemic levels.

**Wounded vs. Fatalities per Attack** (Interactive)\
Most attacks (`{r} casualty_lt10_pct`%) resulted in fewer than 10
casualties (killed and/or wounded) and `{r} deaths_0_pct`% of attacks
resulted in no deaths at all. Hover over the points on this plot to get
information about that specific attack. Note: hovering over a point on
one side of the plot will highlight a corresponding point on the other
side.

**Wounded vs. Fatalities per Weapon Type** (Interactive)\
Most attacks (`{r} pistol_pct`%) were committed using handguns. Among
these, total fatalities were generally less than 20 (except for the
attacks at Virginia Tech, 2007). Similarly, nearly all handgun attacks
resulted in \<20 wounded (except the attack at Fort Cavazos, 2009).
Attacks using rifles accounted for all of the attacks that surpassed 20
deaths. However, a mix of vehicle and rifle attacks accounted for nearly
all attacks with more than 20 wounded. Hover over the points on this
plot to get information about that specific attack.

# Download the Data

## row 1

### row 1, column 1 {width="35%"}

::: {.card .flow title="About the Data" expandable="false"}
It is the mission of the Research Ring at ALERRT to make the Active
Attack Data as freely accessible as possible. Please feel free to
explore the raw data in the window to the right or download the data as
a *.csv* file using the download button below. The codebook for the data
is also accessible below as a *.docx* file. The codebook includes
variable names, value labels (i.e., for factor/character variables), and
summary statistics.

Before downloading the data, please familiarize yourself with the
following notes:

1.  The dataset is organized so that each row corresponds to a unique
    active attack. This means that some variables, like attacker
    characteristics, need some special handling. Because some events
    involved multiple attackers, variables like age, race/ethnicity, and
    sex, are given a special suffix (e.g., *\_1*, *\_2*, *\_3*) that
    correspond to specific attackers. For an attack with only one
    shooter, the demographic variables ending in *\_2* and *\_3* will
    contain missing values. Keep in mind, the suffixes were assigned
    randomly and should not be taken as an indication that individuals
    described by variables ending in *\_1* were somehow more central to
    the attack than the other people involved.

2.  The dataset also includes several variables with the *\_incl*
    suffix. This suffix refers to an "inclusive definition" applied to
    the the variables' coding scheme. ALERRT applies more stringent
    definitions than does the FBI for coding active attack cases. For
    instance, injuries that were sustained during an active attack but
    not directly by the attacker (e.g., sprained ankle from running
    away) are not counted by ALERRT as injuries in our *wound_tot*
    variable. For this reason, there may be differences between our
    numbers (and visualizations) and the official FBI reports
    (represented in the variables ending in *\_incl*).

3.  The dataset includes two variables detailing event resolution. These
    variables are named "resolution" and "resolved_pre_le" and describe
    how each event was resolved and whether that resolution occurred
    prior to the arrival of law enforcement, respectively. Although
    rare, there are a small number of events where the attacker fled the
    scene after law enforcement arrived. As the vast majority of fleeing
    attackers leave the scene before law enforcement arrive, these are
    combined in the resolution data as ending prior to LE arrival.
